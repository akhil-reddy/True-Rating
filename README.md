# True Rating

## Description

This project is used to obtain genuine ratings for a movie. It filters all the fake ratings given by bots to alter the perception of the movie to the public. With the power of Natural Language Processing and BeautifulSoup in Python (for web extraction), it gives a rating based on the reviews written by various critics and movie buffs.
