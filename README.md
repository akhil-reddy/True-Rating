# True Rating

## Description

This project is used to obtain genuine ratings for a movie. It filters all the fake ratings given by bots to alter the image of the movie to the public. With the power of Natural
Language Processing and BeautifulSoup package in Python (for web extraction), it gives a rating based on the reviews written by various critics and movie buffs.

Please read the following:

1)  Before setting the URL of a particular webpage in the DataCreator.py file, please refer to their Terms and Conditions if they support web scraping. If yes, please check with them if you need to obtain a license. If not, I'd advice you check a different review website.

2)  The Prototype.py is a prototype of the complete program and not the complete program. Please edit Prototype.py according to your needs and DataCreator.py with respect to the website you are scraping data from. 

3)  Wherever you encounter '<' and '>' symbols, please edit the content within the '<' and '>' symbols including the symbols with appropriate data described between the symbols.
